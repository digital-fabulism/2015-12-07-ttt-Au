<p>
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>
  and <a href="{{site.dc_site}}">Data Carpentry</a>'s mission is to
  help scientists and engineers get more research done in less time
  and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for scientific
  computing.  This hands-on two-day workshop covers the basics of
  educational psychology and instructional design, and looks at how to
  use these ideas in both intensive workshops and regular classes. The
  workshop is a mix of lectures and hand-on lessons where you practice
  giving a short lesson using approaches learned and implement some of
  the teaching techniques which we will discuss.  This is training for
  teaching, not technical training; you do not need any particular
  technical background, and we will not be teaching that.This workshop
  is based on the constantly revised and updated
 <a href="{{site.swc_githubio}}/instructor-training/">curriculum</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong> The course is aimed at everyone who is
  interested in becoming a better teacher. In particular, this trainig
  is aimed at those who want to become Software and Data Carpentry
  instructors, run workshops and contribute to the Carpentry training
  materials.  You don't have to be currently an instructor or a
  teacher to attend this workshop. But you do need to be willing and
  committed to become one and to improve your teaching techniques.

  <strong>Requirements:</strong> Participants should bring a laptop
  that is Internet connected and has a functioning browser.  If you
  have it, a device for recording audio and video (mobile phones and
  laptops are OK) - throughout the two days, we are going to record
  one another teaching in pairs or threes.  It does not have to be
  high-quality, but it should be good enough that you can understand
  what someone is saying.

      Please also pick up a copy of
      <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Learning-Works-Research-Based-Jossey-Bass/dp/0470484101/">How
      Learning Works</a>, which is the best summary going of research
      in education. It is full of useful insights, and a lot of how we
      teach is based on the findings it reports.  (You do not need to read
      this before the class, but you will want it as a reference afterward.)

  If you are interested in doing more reading,
  Huston's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Teaching-What-You-Dont-Know/dp/0674066170">Teaching What You Don't Know</a>
  is a lot of fun: many of you will recognize yourselves in these stories.
  Past participants have also enjoyed
  Green's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Building-Better-Teacher-Teaching-Everyone/dp/0393081591">Building a Better Teacher</a>,
  which is a well-written look at why educational reforms in the past 50 years have mostly failed,
  and about what we should be doing instead.
